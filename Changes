          - better normalization of uris in errors
          - now detecting infinite loops separately from deep traversal
          - optionally collect annotations
          - support for the "unevaluatedItems" and "unevaluatedProperties"

          - no longer allowing adding another schema document with a duplicate
            uri but different schema content (some collision checks were too

            initial target scope

0.008     2020-06-22 04:24:06Z
          - fix bad syntax used in a test

0.007     2020-06-21 21:20:33Z
          - raise some inadequate prereq declarations
          - fix incorrect canonical uri when evaluating a (sub)schema using a
            non-canonical uri

          - add support for evaluation against a uri
          - add "add_schema" interface for using additional schema documents
            within the implementation
          - support using the "format" keyword as an assertion, with the
            "validate_formats" option

0.005     2020-06-09 01:54:05Z
          - fix some edge cases with usage of $recursiveAnchor, $recursiveRef
          - fixed several issues with resource identification within schema
            documents
