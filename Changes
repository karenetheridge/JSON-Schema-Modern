Revision history for JSON-Schema-Draft201909

{{$NEXT}}
          - delegate all logic to JSON::Schema::Modern; this distribution now
            remains as a deprecated compatibility layer.

0.028     2021-06-08 02:48:07Z
          - fix validation regex for the $anchor keyword
          - unevaluatedItems and unevaluatedProperties keywords are now
            applied after all other keywords in the applicator vocabulary
            (true/false results are not affected, but the order of annotations
            and errors will change)
          - calculate the canonical uri correctly after navigating a $ref:
            using the closest resource identifier to the destination, not the
            one that was used in the $ref

0.027     2021-05-15 18:13:21Z
          - fixed error strings used for failing "dependentRequired"
          - in terse output format, do not discard non-summary errors from
            schema-form of items
          - keywords in the applicator vocabulary are now applied before the
            keywords in the validation vocabulary (true/false results are not
            affected, but the order of annotations and errors will change)
          - improved validation of the "date-time", "date" and "time" formats

0.026     2021-04-08 20:13:27Z
          - fix scoping of annotations from uncle keywords (siblings of the
            schema's parent) that were improperly visible to unevaluatedItems,
            unevaluatedProperties
          - 'result' attribute in JSON::Schema::Draft201909::Result has been
            renamed to 'valid', to better match what it represents (a boolean)

0.025     2021-03-30 05:36:14Z
          - minor changes to error strings to distinguish between issues that
            can be determined from static inspection of schema(s), and those
            that only arise during runtime evaluation (such as URIs that
            map to missing schema documents, or inconsistent configuration
            values).
          - more validity checks at traversal time of $ref, $schema,
            $vocabulary values
          - update ipv4 format validation to reject leading zeroes in octets,
            helping avoid a newly-discovered vulnerability in netmasks

0.024     2021-03-23 21:53:42Z
          - the default value for "validate_formats" is once again false (it
            became true in v0.020), to properly conform to the specification

0.023     2021-02-21 18:36:32Z
          - fix "try/catch is experimental" warnings in perl 5.33.7

0.022     2021-02-07 17:33:14Z
          - fix erroneous use of postfix dereference (closes #42).

0.021     2021-02-06 18:50:42Z
          - [Pp]roperties$ keywords now always produce annotations when
            evaluating successfully, even if there were no matching properties
          - added the "strict_basic" output format, for strict (but incorrect)
            adherence to the draft 2019-09 specification

0.020     2021-01-02 17:12:09Z
          - the default value for "validate_formats" is now true, to reflect
            the most typical usecase.
          - gracefully handle the erroneous schema { "type": null }
          - fixes to relative-json-pointer format validation
          - new "annotate_unknown_keywords" config option

          - further improvements to the "terse" output format
          - add_schema will now die with a Result object rather than a
            listref of Error objects, when the document contains errors.

0.018     2020-12-07 18:22:07Z
          - now can correctly evaluate schemas containing unevaluatedItems,
            unevaluatedProperties keywords without the user having to
            explicitly set collect_annotations => 1 in the constructor
          - fix error in "terse" output formatting that mistakenly dropped
            some unevaluatedProperties errors

0.017     2020-11-24 19:15:18Z
          - refactor keyword implementations into separate vocabulary classes,
            to faciliate future support for custom vocabularies
          - traverse the schema before evaluation, for more correct
            and complete extraction of identifiers and invalid syntax
          - add callbacks to traverse(), to easily find keywords of interest

0.016     2020-11-18 18:18:40Z
          - further fixes to infinite loop detection
          - fix dereference error when evaluating "definitions",
            "dependencies"
          - when adding two schema documents with no canonical uri, preserve
            knowledge of other identifiers found in the first document
          - add_schema() no longer adds additional URIs to the document
            object, only the evaluator

          - fix detection of bad $recursiveAnchor
          - fix canonical uri calculation for $schema, $recursiveAnchor, and
            infinite loop detection
          - for output_format=terse, do not omit the important errors for
            unevaluated* when annotation collection is disabled

0.013     2020-09-15 19:14:53Z
          - detect more cases of resource identifier collisions
          - fix resolution of relative $ids

          - improved "ipv6" format validation

0.009     2020-07-07 19:54:44Z
          - no longer allowing adding another schema document with a duplicate
            uri but different schema content (some collision checks were too
            lax).
          - fix behaviour of $recursiveRef without an $recursiveAnchor in the
            initial target scope
