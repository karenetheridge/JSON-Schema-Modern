          - skip acceptance test for integer overflow when nvsize is too
            large to produce the expected error
          - support for specification version draft7, through the "$schema"
            keyword and the new 'specification_version' constructor option

0.512     2021-06-09 02:29:23Z
          - distribution has been renamed from JSON-Schema-Draft201909 to
            JSON-Schema-Modern. JSON::Schema::Draft201909 lives on as a

          - unevaluatedItems and unevaluatedProperties keywords are now
            applied after all other keywords in the applicator vocabulary

            and errors will change)
          - calculate the canonical uri correctly after navigating a $ref:
            using the closest resource identifier to the destination, not the

            schema-form of items
          - keywords in the applicator vocabulary are now applied before the
            keywords in the validation vocabulary (true/false results are not
            affected, but the order of annotations and errors will change)
          - improved validation of the "date-time", "date" and "time" formats

0.026     2021-04-08 20:13:27Z
          - fix scoping of annotations from uncle keywords (siblings of the
            schema's parent) that were improperly visible to unevaluatedItems,
            unevaluatedProperties
          - 'result' attribute in JSON::Schema::Draft201909::Result has been
            renamed to 'valid', to better match what it represents (a boolean)

0.025     2021-03-30 05:36:14Z
          - minor changes to error strings to distinguish between issues that
            can be determined from static inspection of schema(s), and those
            that only arise during runtime evaluation (such as URIs that
            map to missing schema documents, or inconsistent configuration
            values).
          - more validity checks at traversal time of $ref, $schema,
            $vocabulary values
          - update ipv4 format validation to reject leading zeroes in octets,
            helping avoid a newly-discovered vulnerability in netmasks

          - the default value for "validate_formats" is once again false (it
            became true in v0.020), to properly conform to the specification

0.023     2021-02-21 18:36:32Z
          - fix "try/catch is experimental" warnings in perl 5.33.7

0.021     2021-02-06 18:50:42Z
          - [Pp]roperties$ keywords now always produce annotations when
            evaluating successfully, even if there were no matching properties
          - added the "strict_basic" output format, for strict (but incorrect)
            adherence to the draft 2019-09 specification

0.020     2021-01-02 17:12:09Z

          - fixes to relative-json-pointer format validation

0.018     2020-12-07 18:22:07Z
          - now can correctly evaluate schemas containing unevaluatedItems,
            unevaluatedProperties keywords without the user having to
            explicitly set collect_annotations => 1 in the constructor
          - fix error in "terse" output formatting that mistakenly dropped
            some unevaluatedProperties errors

0.017     2020-11-24 19:15:18Z
          - refactor keyword implementations into separate vocabulary classes,
            to faciliate future support for custom vocabularies
          - traverse the schema before evaluation, for more correct
            and complete extraction of identifiers and invalid syntax

          - add_schema() no longer adds additional URIs to the document
            object, only the evaluator
