=head1 NAME

JSON::Schema::Modern - Validate data against a schema

=head1 VERSION

version 0.514

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JSON::Schema::Modern;

  $js = JSON::Schema::Modern->new(
    output_format => 'flag',
    ... # other options
  );
  $result = $js->evaluate($instance_data, $schema_data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module aims to be a fully-compliant L<JSON Schema|https://json-schema.org/> evaluator and
validator, targeting the currently-latest
L<Draft 2019-09|https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2019-09-formerly-known-as-draft-8>
version of the specification.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

=head2 specification_version

Indicates which version of the JSON Schema specification is used during evaluation. When not set,
this value is derived from the C<$schema> keyword in the schema used in evaluation, or defaults to
the latest (supported) version (draft2019-09). When left unset, the use of C<$schema> keywords in
the schema is permitted, to switch between draft versions.

May be one of:

=over 4

=item *

L<C<draft2019-09>|https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2019-09-formerly-known-as-draft-8>, corresponding to metaschema C<https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema>.

=item *

L<C<draft7>|https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-7>, corresponding to metaschema C<http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#>

=back

=head2 output_format

One of: C<flag>, C<basic>, C<strict_basic>, C<detailed>, C<verbose>, C<terse>. Defaults to C<basic>.
Passed to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result/output_format>.

=head2 short_circuit

When true, evaluation will return early in any execution path as soon as the outcome can be
determined, rather than continuing to find all errors or annotations. Be aware that this can result
in invalid results in the presence of keywords that depend on annotations, namely
C<unevaluatedItems> and C<unevaluatedProperties>.

Defaults to true when C<output_format> is C<flag>, and false otherwise.

=head2 max_traversal_depth

The maximum number of levels deep a schema traversal may go, before evaluation is halted. This is to
protect against accidental infinite recursion, such as from two subschemas that each reference each
other, or badly-written schemas that could be optimized. Defaults to 50.

=head2 validate_formats

When true, the C<format> keyword will be treated as an assertion, not merely an annotation. Defaults
to false.

=head2 format_validations

An optional hashref that allows overriding the validation method for formats, or adding new ones.
Overrides to existing formats (see L</Format Validation>)
must be specified in the form of C<< { $format_name => $format_sub } >>, where
the format sub is a coderef that takes one argument and returns a boolean result. New formats must
be specified in the form of C<< { $format_name => { type => $type, sub => $format_sub } } >>,
where the type indicates which of the core JSON Schema types (null, object, array, boolean, string,
number, or integer) the instance value must be for the format validation to be considered.

=head2 collect_annotations

When true, annotations are collected from keywords that produce them, when validation succeeds.
These annotations are available in the returned result (see L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result>).
Defaults to false.

=head2 annotate_unknown_keywords

When true, keywords that are not recognized by any vocabulary are collected as annotations (where
the value of the annotation is the value of the keyword). L</collect_annotations> must also be true
in order for this to have any effect.
Defaults to false (for now).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 evaluate_json_string

  $result = $js->evaluate_json_string($data_as_json_string, $schema);
  $result = $js->evaluate_json_string($data_as_json_string, $schema, { collect_annotations => 1});

Evaluates the provided instance data against the known schema document.

The data is in the form of a JSON-encoded string (in accordance with
L<RFC8259|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259>). B<The string is expected to be UTF-8 encoded.>

The schema must be in one of these forms:

=over 4

=item *

a Perl data structure, such as what is returned from a JSON decode operation,

=item *

a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document> object,

=item *

or a URI string indicating the location where such a schema is located.

=back

Optionally, a hashref can be passed as a third parameter which allows changing the values of the
L</short_circuit>, L</collect_annotations>, L</annotate_unknown_keywords> and/or
L</validate_formats> settings for just this evaluation call.

The result is a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object, which can also be used as a boolean.

=head2 evaluate

  $result = $js->evaluate($instance_data, $schema);
  $result = $js->evaluate($instance_data, $schema, { short_circuit => 0 });

Evaluates the provided instance data against the known schema document.

The data is in the form of an unblessed nested Perl data structure representing any type that JSON
allows: null, boolean, string, number, object, array. (See L</TYPES> below.)

The schema must be in one of these forms:

=over 4

=item *

a Perl data structure, such as what is returned from a JSON decode operation,

=item *

a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document> object,

=item *

or a URI string indicating the location where such a schema is located.

=back

Optionally, a hashref can be passed as a third parameter which allows changing the values of the
L</short_circuit>, L</collect_annotations>, L</annotate_unknown_keywords> and/or
L</validate_formats> settings for just this
evaluation call.

The result is a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object, which can also be used as a boolean.

=head2 traverse

  $result = $js->traverse($schema);
  $result = $js->traverse($schema, { initial_schema_uri => 'http://example.com' });

Traverses the provided schema without evaluating it against any instance data. Returns the
internal state object accumulated during the traversal, including any identifiers found therein, and
any errors found during parsing. For internal purposes only.

You can pass a series of callback subs to this method corresponding to keywords, which is useful for
extracting data from within schemas and skipping properties that may look like keywords but actually
are not (for example C<{"const":{"$ref": "this is not actually a $ref"}}>). This feature is highly
experimental and is highly likely to change in the future.

For example, to find the resolved targets of all C<$ref> keywords in a schema document:

  my @refs;
  JSON::Schema::Modern->new->traverse($schema, {
    callbacks => {
      '$ref' => sub ($schema, $state) {
        push @refs, Mojo::URL->new($schema->{'$ref'})
          ->to_abs(JSON::Schema::Modern::Utilities::canonical_schema_uri($state));
      }
    },
  });

=head2 add_schema

  $js->add_schema($uri => $schema);
  $js->add_schema($uri => $document);
  $js->add_schema($schema);
  $js->add_schema($document);

Introduces the (unblessed, nested) Perl data structure or L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document>
object, representing a JSON Schema, to the implementation, registering it under the indicated URI if
provided (and if not, C<''> will be used if no other identifier can be found within).

You B<MUST> call C<add_schema> for any external resources that a schema may reference via C<$ref>
before calling L</evaluate>, other than the standard metaschemas which are loaded from a local cache
as needed.

Returns C<undef> if the resource could not be found;
if there were errors in the document, will die with these errors;
otherwise returns the L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document> that contains the added schema.

=head2 get

  my $schema = $js->get($uri);
  my ($schema, $canonical_uri) = $js->get($uri);

Fetches the Perl data structure representing the JSON Schema at the indicated URI. When called in
list context, the canonical URI of that location is also returned, as a L<Mojo::URL>. Returns
C<undef> if the schema with that URI has not been loaded (or cached).

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=head2 Types

Perl is a more loosely-typed language than JSON. This module delves into a value's internal
representation in an attempt to derive the true "intended" type of the value. However, if a value is
used in another context (for example, a numeric value is concatenated into a string, or a numeric
string is used in an arithmetic operation), additional flags can be added onto the variable causing
it to resemble the other type. This should not be an issue if data validation is occurring
immediately after decoding a JSON payload, or if the JSON string itself is passed to this module.
If this turns out to be an issue in real environments, I may have to implement a C<lax_scalars>
option.

For more information, see L<Cpanel::JSON::XS/MAPPING>.

=head2 Format Validation

By default, formats are treated only as annotations, not assertions. When L</validate_format> is
true, strings are also checked against the format as specified in the schema. At present the
following formats are supported (use of any other formats than these will always evaluate as true):

=over 4

=item *

C<date-time>

=item *

C<date>

=item *

C<time>

=item *

C<duration>

=item *

C<email>

=item *

C<idn-email>

=item *

C<hostname>

=item *

C<idn-hostname>

=item *

C<ipv4>

=item *

C<ipv6>

=item *

C<uri>

=item *

C<uri-reference>

=item *

C<iri>

=item *

C<uuid>

=item *

C<json-pointer>

=item *

C<relative-json-pointer>

=item *

C<regex>

=back

A few optional prerequisites are needed for some of these (if the prerequisite is missing,
validation will always succeed):

=over 4

=item *

C<date-time>, C<date>, and C<time> require L<Time::Moment>

=item *

C<email> and C<idn-email> require L<Email::Address::XS> version 1.01 (or higher)

=item *

C<hostname> and C<idn-hostname> require L<Data::Validate::Domain>

=item *

C<idn-hostname> requires L<Net::IDN::Encode>

=back

=head2 Specification Compliance

Until version 1.000 is released, this implementation is not fully specification-compliant.

To date, missing features (some of which are optional, but still quite useful) include:

=over 4

=item *

loading schema documents from disk

=item *

loading schema documents from the network

=item *

loading schema documents from a local web application (e.g. L<Mojolicious>)

=item *

additional output formats beyond C<flag>, C<basic>, C<strict_basic>, and C<terse> (L<https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.10>)

=item *

examination of the C<$schema> keyword for deviation from the standard draft metaschemas, including changes to vocabulary behaviour

=item *

changing the draft specification version semantics after construction time

=back

Additionally, some small errors in the specification (which have been fixed in the next draft
specification version) are fixed here rather than implementing the precise but unintended behaviour,
most notably in the use of json pointers rather than fragment-only URIs in C<instanceLocation> and
C<keywordLocation> in annotations and errors. (Use the C<strict_basic>
L<JSON::Schema::Modern/output_format> to revert this change.)

=head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

The C<pattern> and C<patternProperties> keywords, and the C<regex> format validator,
evaluate regular expressions from the schema.
No effort is taken (at this time) to sanitize the regular expressions for embedded code or
potentially pathological constructs that may pose a security risk, either via denial of service
or by allowing exposure to the internals of your application. B<DO NOT USE SCHEMAS FROM UNTRUSTED
SOURCES.>
