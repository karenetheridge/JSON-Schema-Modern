0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This class provides a wrapper and methods for interacting with an array. All
0.000000,0,0.000000,methods are written to emulate/match existing behavior that exists with Moose's
0.000000,0,0.000000,native traits.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Just like Perl's builtin splice. In scalar context, this returns the last
0.000000,0,0.000000,element removed, or undef if no elements were removed. In list context, this
0.000000,0,0.000000,returns all the elements removed from the array.

0.000000,0,0.000000,This method requires at least one argument.
