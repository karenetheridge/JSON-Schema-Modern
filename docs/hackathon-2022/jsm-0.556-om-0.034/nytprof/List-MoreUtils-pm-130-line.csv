0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DESCRIPTION
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,B<List::MoreUtils> provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
0.000000,0,0.000000,lists which is not going to go into L<List::Util>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl
0.000000,0,0.000000,code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
0.000000,0,0.000000,performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
0.000000,0,0.000000,these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module
0.000000,0,0.000000,couldn't be compiled on this machine.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 EXPORTS
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Default behavior
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Nothing by default. To import all of this module's symbols use the C<:all> tag.
0.000000,0,0.000000,Otherwise functions can be imported by name as usual:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use List::MoreUtils ':all';
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use List::MoreUtils qw{ any firstidx };
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Because historical changes to the API might make upgrading List::MoreUtils
0.000000,0,0.000000,difficult for some projects, the legacy API is available via special import
0.000000,0,0.000000,tags.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Like version 0.22 (last release with original API)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This API was available from 2006 to 2009, returning undef for empty lists on
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<all>/C<any>/C<none>/C<notall>:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.22';
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.22.
0.000000,0,0.000000,However, it will import C<any_u> as C<any>, C<all_u> as C<all>, C<none_u> as
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<none>, and C<notall_u> as C<notall>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Like version 0.24 (first incompatible change)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This API was available from 2010 to 2011.  It changed the return value of C<none>
0.000000,0,0.000000,and added the C<bsearch> function.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.24';
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.24.
0.000000,0,0.000000,However it will import C<any_u> as C<any>, C<all_u> as C<all>, and
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<notall_u> as C<notall>.  It will import C<none> as described in
0.000000,0,0.000000,the documentation below (true for empty list).
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Like version 0.33 (second incompatible change)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This API was available from 2011 to 2014. It is widely used in several CPAN
0.000000,0,0.000000,modules and thus it's closest to the current API.  It changed the return values
0.000000,0,0.000000,of C<any>, C<all>, and C<notall>.  It added the C<sort_by> and C<nsort_by> functions
0.000000,0,0.000000,and the C<distinct> alias for C<uniq>.  It omitted C<bsearch>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use List::MoreUtils ':like_0.33';
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This import tag will import all functions available as of version 0.33.  Note:
0.000000,0,0.000000,it will not import C<bsearch> for consistency with the 0.33 API.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head3 I<Treatment of an empty list>
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an
0.000000,0,0.000000,empty list:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=over
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=item *
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Reduction to an identity (boolean)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=item *
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Result is undefined (three-valued)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=back
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,In the first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is
0.000000,0,0.000000,determined by a mathematical reduction to an identity depending on whether
0.000000,0,0.000000,the underlying comparison is "or" or "and".  Conceptually:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,"any are true"      "all are true"
0.000000,0,0.000000,--------------      --------------
0.000000,0,0.000000,2 elements:     A || B || 0         A && B && 1
0.000000,0,0.000000,1 element:      A || 0              A && 1
0.000000,0,0.000000,0 elements:     0                   1
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction
0.000000,0,0.000000,applied to an empty list returns C<undef> rather than true or false 
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Junctions with a C<_u> suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those

0.000000,0,0.000000,to the string value of some accessor, such as
0.000000,0,0.000000,

0.000000,0,0.000000,index of the element in C<$b>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This function has been added if one might need the extra of the index

0.000000,0,0.000000,=head3 minmax LIST
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Calculates the minimum and maximum of LIST and returns a two element list with
0.000000,0,0.000000,the first element being the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the
0.000000,0,0.000000,empty list if LIST was empty.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The C<minmax> algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each
0.000000,0,0.000000,element is compared to two values being the so far calculated min and max value
0.000000,0,0.000000,in that it only requires 3n/2 - 2 comparisons. Thus it is the most efficient
0.000000,0,0.000000,possible algorithm.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact
0.000000,0,0.000000,that there are more lines of Perl code involved. Therefore, LIST needs to be
0.000000,0,0.000000,fairly big in order for C<minmax> to win over a naive implementation. This
0.000000,0,0.000000,limitation does not apply to the XS version.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Computes the minimum and maximum of LIST using string compare and returns a
0.000000,0,0.000000,two element list with the first element being the minimum and the second the
0.000000,0,0.000000,maximum. Returns the empty list if LIST was empty.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The implementation is similar to C<minmax>.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,When C<LIST_MOREUTILS_PP> is set, the module will always use the pure-Perl
0.000000,0,0.000000,implementation and not the XS one. This environment variable is really just
0.000000,0,0.000000,there for the test-suite to force testing the Perl implementation, and possibly
0.000000,0,0.000000,for reporting of bugs. I don't see any reason to use it in a production
0.000000,0,0.000000,environment.

0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 MAINTENANCE
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The maintenance goal is to preserve the documented semantics of the API;
0.000000,0,0.000000,bug fixes that bring actual behavior in line with semantics are allowed.
0.000000,0,0.000000,New API functions may be added over time.  If a backwards incompatible
0.000000,0,0.000000,change is unavoidable, we will attempt to provide support for the legacy
0.000000,0,0.000000,API using the same export tag mechanism currently in place.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This module attempts to use few non-core dependencies. Non-core
0.000000,0,0.000000,configuration and testing modules will be bundled when reasonable;
0.000000,0,0.000000,run-time dependencies will be added only if they deliver substantial
0.000000,0,0.000000,benefit.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,While contributions are appreciated, a contribution should not cause more
0.000000,0,0.000000,effort for the maintainer than the contribution itself saves (see

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,There is a problem with a bug in 5.6.x perls. It is a syntax error to write
0.000000,0,0.000000,things like:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } qw{ foo bar baz };
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,It has to be written as either
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } 'foo', 'bar', 'baz';
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,or
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } my @dummy = qw/foo bar baz/;
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Perl 5.5.x and Perl 5.8.x don't suffer from this limitation.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If you have a functionality that you could imagine being in this module, please
0.000000,0,0.000000,drop me a line. This module's policy will be less strict than L<List::Util>'s
0.000000,0,0.000000,when it comes to additions as it isn't a core module.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,When you report bugs, it would be nice if you could additionally give me the
0.000000,0,0.000000,output of your program with the environment variable C<LIST_MOREUTILS_PP> set
0.000000,0,0.000000,to a true value. That way I know where to look for the problem (in XS,
0.000000,0,0.000000,pure-Perl or possibly both).
