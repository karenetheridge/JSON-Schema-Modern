0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DESCRIPTION
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of
0.000000,0,0.000000,Perl modules, which are normally handled at compile time.  This module
0.000000,0,0.000000,avoids using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level
0.000000,0,0.000000,infrastructure.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same syntax
0.000000,0,0.000000,that is used for barewords in Perl source.  In principle this syntax
0.000000,0,0.000000,can vary between versions of Perl, and this module applies the syntax of
0.000000,0,0.000000,the Perl on which it is running.  In practice the usable syntax hasn't
0.000000,0,0.000000,changed yet.  There's some intent for Unicode module names to be supported
0.000000,0,0.000000,in the future, but this hasn't yet amounted to any consistent facility.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include
0.000000,0,0.000000,workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding C<require>.  These
0.000000,0,0.000000,workarounds are applied on any Perl version where the bugs exist, except
0.000000,0,0.000000,for a case where one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in
0.000000,0,0.000000,pure Perl.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Module name syntax
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The usable module name syntax has not changed from Perl 5.000 up to
0.000000,0,0.000000,Perl 5.19.8.  The syntax is composed entirely of ASCII characters.
0.000000,0,0.000000,From Perl 5.6 onwards there has been some attempt to allow the use of
0.000000,0,0.000000,non-ASCII Unicode characters in Perl source, but it was fundamentally
0.000000,0,0.000000,broken (like the entirety of Perl 5.6's Unicode handling) and remained
0.000000,0,0.000000,pretty much entirely unusable until it got some attention in the Perl
0.000000,0,0.000000,5.15 series.  Although Unicode is now consistently accepted by the
0.000000,0,0.000000,parser in some places, it remains broken for module names.  Furthermore,
0.000000,0,0.000000,there has not yet been any work on how to map Unicode module names into
0.000000,0,0.000000,filenames, so in that respect also Unicode module names are unusable.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The module name syntax is, precisely: the string must consist of one or
0.000000,0,0.000000,more segments separated by C<::>; each segment must consist of one or more
0.000000,0,0.000000,identifier characters (ASCII alphanumerics plus "_"); the first character
0.000000,0,0.000000,of the string must not be a digit.  Thus "C<IO::File>", "C<warnings>",
0.000000,0,0.000000,and "C<foo::123::x_0>" are all valid module names, whereas "C<IO::>"
0.000000,0,0.000000,and "C<1foo::bar>" are not.  C<'> separators are not permitted by this
0.000000,0,0.000000,module, though they remain usable in Perl source, being translated to
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<::> in the parser.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Core bugs worked around
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The first bug worked around is core bug [perl #68590], which causes
0.000000,0,0.000000,lexical state in one file to leak into another that is C<require>d/C<use>d
0.000000,0,0.000000,from it.  This bug is present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10, and is
0.000000,0,0.000000,fixed in Perl 5.11.0.  From Perl 5.9.4 up to Perl 5.10.0 no satisfactory
0.000000,0,0.000000,workaround is possible in pure Perl.  The workaround means that modules
0.000000,0,0.000000,loaded via this module don't suffer this pollution of their lexical
0.000000,0,0.000000,state.  Modules loaded in other ways, or via this module on the Perl
0.000000,0,0.000000,versions where the pure Perl workaround is impossible, remain vulnerable.
0.000000,0,0.000000,The module L<Lexical::SealRequireHints> provides a complete workaround
0.000000,0,0.000000,for this bug.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The second bug worked around causes some kinds of failure in module
0.000000,0,0.000000,loading, principally compilation errors in the loaded module, to be
0.000000,0,0.000000,recorded in C<%INC> as if they were successful, so later attempts to load
0.000000,0,0.000000,the same module immediately indicate success.  This bug is present up
0.000000,0,0.000000,to Perl 5.8.9, and is fixed in Perl 5.9.0.  The workaround means that a
0.000000,0,0.000000,compilation error in a module loaded via this module won't be cached as
0.000000,0,0.000000,a success.  Modules loaded in other ways remain liable to produce bogus
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<%INC> entries, and if a bogus entry exists then it will mislead this
0.000000,0,0.000000,module if it is used to re-attempt loading.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The third bug worked around causes the wrong context to be seen at
0.000000,0,0.000000,file scope of a loaded module, if C<require> is invoked in a location
0.000000,0,0.000000,that inherits context from a higher scope.  This bug is present up to
0.000000,0,0.000000,Perl 5.11.2, and is fixed in Perl 5.11.3.  The workaround means that
0.000000,0,0.000000,a module loaded via this module will always see the correct context.
0.000000,0,0.000000,Modules loaded in other ways remain vulnerable.

0.000000,0,0.000000,Perls prior to 5.25.11.  If a package is actually defined by some means
0.000000,0,0.000000,other than a module, then applying this function to it causes a spurious
0.000000,0,0.000000,attempt to load a module that is expected to be non-existent.  If a
0.000000,0,0.000000,module actually exists under that name then it will be unintentionally
0.000000,0,0.000000,loaded.  If C<.> is in C<@INC> and this code is ever run with the current
0.000000,0,0.000000,directory being one writable by a malicious user (such as F</tmp>), then
0.000000,0,0.000000,the malicious user can easily cause the victim to run arbitrary code, by
0.000000,0,0.000000,creating a module file under the predictable spuriously-loaded name in the
0.000000,0,0.000000,writable directory.  Generally, optional module loading should be avoided.
