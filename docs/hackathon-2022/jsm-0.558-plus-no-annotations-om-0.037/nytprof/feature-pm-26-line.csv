0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DESCRIPTION
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,It is usually impossible to add new syntax to Perl without breaking
0.000000,0,0.000000,some existing programs.  This pragma provides a way to minimize that
0.000000,0,0.000000,risk. New syntactic constructs, or new semantic meanings to older
0.000000,0,0.000000,constructs, can be enabled by C<use feature 'foo'>, and will be parsed
0.000000,0,0.000000,only when the appropriate feature pragma is in scope.  (Nevertheless, the
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<CORE::> prefix provides access to all Perl keywords, regardless of this
0.000000,0,0.000000,pragma.)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 Lexical effect
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Like other pragmas (C<use strict>, for example), features have a lexical
0.000000,0,0.000000,effect.  C<use feature qw(foo)> will only make the feature "foo" available
0.000000,0,0.000000,from that point to the end of the enclosing block.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,{
0.000000,0,0.000000,use feature 'say';
0.000000,0,0.000000,say "say is available here";
0.000000,0,0.000000,}
0.000000,0,0.000000,print "But not here.\n";
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 C<no feature>
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Features can also be turned off by using C<no feature "foo">.  This too
0.000000,0,0.000000,has lexical effect.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use feature 'say';
0.000000,0,0.000000,say "say is available here";
0.000000,0,0.000000,{
0.000000,0,0.000000,no feature 'say';
0.000000,0,0.000000,print "But not here.\n";
0.000000,0,0.000000,}
0.000000,0,0.000000,say "Yet it is here.";
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<no feature> with no features specified will reset to the default group.  To
0.000000,0,0.000000,disable I<all> features (an unusual request!) use C<no feature ':all'>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 AVAILABLE FEATURES
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'say' feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<use feature 'say'> tells the compiler to enable the Raku-inspired
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<say> function.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,See L<perlfunc/say> for details.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature is available starting with Perl 5.10.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'state' feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<use feature 'state'> tells the compiler to enable C<state>
0.000000,0,0.000000,variables.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,See L<perlsub/"Persistent Private Variables"> for details.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature is available starting with Perl 5.10.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'switch' feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,B<WARNING>: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
0.000000,0,0.000000,change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
0.000000,0,0.000000,warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,no warnings "experimental::smartmatch";
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<use feature 'switch'> tells the compiler to enable the Raku
0.000000,0,0.000000,given/when construct.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,See L<perlsyn/"Switch Statements"> for details.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature is available starting with Perl 5.10.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'unicode_strings' feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<use feature 'unicode_strings'> tells the compiler to use Unicode rules
0.000000,0,0.000000,in all string operations executed within its scope (unless they are also
0.000000,0,0.000000,within the scope of either C<use locale> or C<use bytes>).  The same applies
0.000000,0,0.000000,to all regular expressions compiled within the scope, even if executed outside
0.000000,0,0.000000,it.  It does not change the internal representation of strings, but only how
0.000000,0,0.000000,they are interpreted.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<no feature 'unicode_strings'> tells the compiler to use the traditional
0.000000,0,0.000000,Perl rules wherein the native character set rules is used unless it is
0.000000,0,0.000000,clear to Perl that Unicode is desired.  This can lead to some surprises
0.000000,0,0.000000,when the behavior suddenly changes.  (See
0.000000,0,0.000000,L<perlunicode/The "Unicode Bug"> for details.)  For this reason, if you are
0.000000,0,0.000000,potentially using Unicode in your program, the
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<use feature 'unicode_strings'> subpragma is B<strongly> recommended.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature is available starting with Perl 5.12; was almost fully
0.000000,0,0.000000,implemented in Perl 5.14; and extended in Perl 5.16 to cover C<quotemeta>;
0.000000,0,0.000000,was extended further in Perl 5.26 to cover L<the range
0.000000,0,0.000000,operator|perlop/Range Operators>; and was extended again in Perl 5.28 to
0.000000,0,0.000000,cover L<special-cased whitespace splitting|perlfunc/split>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'unicode_eval' and 'evalbytes' features
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Together, these two features are intended to replace the legacy string
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<eval> function, which behaves problematically in some instances.  They are
0.000000,0,0.000000,available starting with Perl 5.16, and are enabled by default by a
0.000000,0,0.000000,S<C<use 5.16>> or higher declaration.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<unicode_eval> changes the behavior of plain string C<eval> to work more
0.000000,0,0.000000,consistently, especially in the Unicode world.  Certain (mis)behaviors
0.000000,0,0.000000,couldn't be changed without breaking some things that had come to rely on
0.000000,0,0.000000,them, so the feature can be enabled and disabled.  Details are at
0.000000,0,0.000000,L<perlfunc/Under the "unicode_eval" feature>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<evalbytes> is like string C<eval>, but it treats its argument as a byte
0.000000,0,0.000000,string. Details are at L<perlfunc/evalbytes EXPR>.  Without a
0.000000,0,0.000000,S<C<use feature 'evalbytes'>> nor a S<C<use v5.16>> (or higher) declaration in
0.000000,0,0.000000,the current scope, you can still access it by instead writing
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<CORE::evalbytes>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'current_sub' feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This provides the C<__SUB__> token that returns a reference to the current
0.000000,0,0.000000,subroutine or C<undef> outside of a subroutine.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature is available starting with Perl 5.16.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 The 'array_base' feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature supported the legacy C<$[> variable.  See L<perlvar/$[>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,It was on by default but disabled under C<use v5.16> (see

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,In Perl versions prior to 5.26, this feature enabled

0.000000,0,0.000000,and scalar dereference are available in double-quotish interpolations. For
0.000000,0,0.000000,example, it makes the following two statements equivalent:

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The 'postderef' feature was used in Perl 5.20 and Perl 5.22 to enable
0.000000,0,0.000000,postfix dereference syntax outside double-quotish interpolations. In those
0.000000,0,0.000000,versions, using it triggered the C<experimental::postderef> warning in the
0.000000,0,0.000000,same way as the 'postderef_qq' feature did. As of Perl 5.24, this syntax is
0.000000,0,0.000000,not only no longer experimental, but it is enabled for all Perl code,

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This enables syntax for declaring subroutine arguments as lexical variables.
0.000000,0,0.000000,For example, for this subroutine:

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This makes the four standard bitwise operators (C<& | ^ ~>) treat their
0.000000,0,0.000000,operands consistently as numbers, and introduces four new dotted operators
0.000000,0,0.000000,(C<&. |. ^. ~.>) that treat their operands consistently as strings.  The
0.000000,0,0.000000,same applies to the assignment variants (C<&= |= ^= &.= |.= ^.=>).

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature is available from Perl 5.22 onwards.  Starting in Perl 5.28,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<use v5.28> will enable the feature.  Before 5.28, it was still
0.000000,0,0.000000,experimental and would emit a warning in the "experimental::bitwise"

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This allows a reference to a variable to be declared with C<my>, C<state>,
0.000000,0,0.000000,our C<our>, or localized with C<local>.  It is intended mainly for use in
0.000000,0,0.000000,conjunction with the "refaliasing" feature.  See L<perlref/Declaring a

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This allows the use of the C<isa> infix operator, which tests whether the

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This feature enables multidimensional array emulation, a perl 4 (or
0.000000,0,0.000000,earlier) feature that was used to emulate multidimensional arrays with
0.000000,0,0.000000,hashes.  This works by converting code like C<< $foo{$x, $y} >> into
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<< $foo{join($;, $x, $y)} >>.  It is enabled by default, but can be

0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 IMPLICIT LOADING
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Instead of loading feature bundles by name, it is easier to let Perl do
0.000000,0,0.000000,implicit loading of a feature bundle for you.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,There are two ways to load the C<feature> pragma implicitly:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=over 4
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=item *
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,By using the C<-E> switch on the Perl command-line instead of C<-e>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,That will enable the feature bundle for that version of Perl in the
0.000000,0,0.000000,main compilation unit (that is, the one-liner that follows C<-E>).
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=item *
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,By explicitly requiring a minimum Perl version number for your program, with
0.000000,0,0.000000,the C<use VERSION> construct.  That is,
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use v5.10.0;
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,will do an implicit
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,no feature ':all';
0.000000,0,0.000000,use feature ':5.10';
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,and so on.  Note how the trailing sub-version
0.000000,0,0.000000,is automatically stripped from the
0.000000,0,0.000000,version.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,But to avoid portability warnings (see L<perlfunc/use>), you may prefer:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use 5.010;
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,with the same effect.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If the required version is older than Perl 5.10, the ":default" feature
0.000000,0,0.000000,bundle is automatically loaded instead.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Unlike C<use feature ":5.12">, saying C<use v5.12> (or any higher version)
0.000000,0,0.000000,also does the equivalent of C<use strict>; see L<perlfunc/use> for details.
