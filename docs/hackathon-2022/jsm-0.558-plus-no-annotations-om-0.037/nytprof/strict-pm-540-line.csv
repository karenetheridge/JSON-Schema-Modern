0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DESCRIPTION
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The C<strict> pragma disables certain Perl expressions that could behave
0.000000,0,0.000000,unexpectedly or are difficult to debug, turning them into errors. The
0.000000,0,0.000000,effect of this pragma is limited to the current file or scope block.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If no import list is supplied, all possible restrictions are assumed.
0.000000,0,0.000000,(This is the safest mode to operate in, but is sometimes too strict for
0.000000,0,0.000000,casual programming.)  Currently, there are three possible things to be
0.000000,0,0.000000,strict about:  "subs", "vars", and "refs".

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=item C<strict refs>
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This generates a runtime error if you 
0.000000,0,0.000000,use symbolic references (see L<perlref>).
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,use strict 'refs';
0.000000,0,0.000000,$ref = \$foo;
0.000000,0,0.000000,print $$ref;	# ok
0.000000,0,0.000000,$ref = "foo";
0.000000,0,0.000000,print $$ref;	# runtime error; normally ok
0.000000,0,0.000000,$file = "STDOUT";
0.000000,0,0.000000,print $file "Hi!";	# error; note: no comma after $file
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,There is one exception to this rule:

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,is allowed so that C<goto &$AUTOLOAD> would not break under stricture.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=item C<strict vars>
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This generates a compile-time error if you access a variable that was
0.000000,0,0.000000,neither explicitly declared (using any of C<my>, C<our>, C<state>, or C<use
0.000000,0,0.000000,vars>) nor fully qualified.  (Because this is to avoid variable suicide
0.000000,0,0.000000,problems and subtle dynamic scoping issues, a merely C<local> variable isn't
0.000000,0,0.000000,good enough.)  See L<perlfunc/my>, L<perlfunc/our>, L<perlfunc/state>,
0.000000,0,0.000000,L<perlfunc/local>, and L<vars>.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The local() generated a compile-time error because you just touched a global

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Because of their special use by sort(), the variables $a and $b are
0.000000,0,0.000000,exempted from this check.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This disables the poetry optimization, generating a compile-time error if
0.000000,0,0.000000,you try to use a bareword identifier that's not a subroutine, unless it
0.000000,0,0.000000,is a simple identifier (no colons) and that it appears in curly braces,
0.000000,0,0.000000,on the left hand side of the C<< => >> symbol, or has the unary minus
0.000000,0,0.000000,operator applied to it.

0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 HISTORY
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<strict 'subs'>, with Perl 5.6.1, erroneously permitted to use an unquoted
0.000000,0,0.000000,compound identifier (e.g. C<Foo::Bar>) as a hash key (before C<< => >> or
0.000000,0,0.000000,inside curlies), but without forcing it always to a literal string.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Starting with Perl 5.8.1 strict is strict about its restrictions:
0.000000,0,0.000000,if unknown restrictions are used, the strict pragma will abort with
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Unknown 'strict' tag(s) '...'
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,As of version 1.04 (Perl 5.10), strict verifies that it is used as
0.000000,0,0.000000,"strict" to avoid the dreaded Strict trap on case insensitive file
0.000000,0,0.000000,systems.
