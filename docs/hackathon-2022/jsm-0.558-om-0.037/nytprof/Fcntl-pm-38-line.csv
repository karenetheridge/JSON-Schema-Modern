0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 SYNOPSIS
0.000000,0,0.000000,

0.000000,0,0.000000,use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);

0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DESCRIPTION
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This module is just a translation of the C F<fcntl.h> file.
0.000000,0,0.000000,Unlike the old mechanism of requiring a translated F<fcntl.ph>
0.000000,0,0.000000,file, this uses the B<h2xs> program (see the Perl source distribution)
0.000000,0,0.000000,and your native C compiler.  This means that it has a 
0.000000,0,0.000000,far more likely chance of getting the numbers right.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 NOTE
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Only C<#define> symbols get translated; you must still correctly
0.000000,0,0.000000,pack up your own arguments to pass as args for locking functions, etc.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 EXPORTED SYMBOLS
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,By default your system's F_* and O_* constants (eg, F_DUPFD and
0.000000,0,0.000000,O_CREAT) and the FD_CLOEXEC constant are exported into your namespace.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,You can request that the flock() constants (LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX, LOCK_NB
0.000000,0,0.000000,and LOCK_UN) be provided by using the tag C<:flock>.  See L<Exporter>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,You can request that the old constants (FAPPEND, FASYNC, FCREAT,
0.000000,0,0.000000,FDEFER, FEXCL, FNDELAY, FNONBLOCK, FSYNC, FTRUNC) be provided for
0.000000,0,0.000000,compatibility reasons by using the tag C<:Fcompat>.  For new
0.000000,0,0.000000,applications the newer versions of these constants are suggested
0.000000,0,0.000000,(O_APPEND, O_ASYNC, O_CREAT, O_DEFER, O_EXCL, O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK,
0.000000,0,0.000000,O_SYNC, O_TRUNC).
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,For ease of use also the SEEK_* constants (for seek() and sysseek(),
0.000000,0,0.000000,e.g. SEEK_END) and the S_I* constants (for chmod() and stat()) are
0.000000,0,0.000000,available for import.  They can be imported either separately or using
0.000000,0,0.000000,the tags C<:seek> and C<:mode>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Please refer to your native fcntl(2), open(2), fseek(3), lseek(2)
0.000000,0,0.000000,(equal to Perl's seek() and sysseek(), respectively), and chmod(2)
0.000000,0,0.000000,documentation to see what constants are implemented in your system.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,See L<perlopentut> to learn about the uses of the O_* constants
0.000000,0,0.000000,with sysopen().
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,See L<perlfunc/seek> and L<perlfunc/sysseek> about the SEEK_* constants.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,See L<perlfunc/stat> about the S_I* constants.
