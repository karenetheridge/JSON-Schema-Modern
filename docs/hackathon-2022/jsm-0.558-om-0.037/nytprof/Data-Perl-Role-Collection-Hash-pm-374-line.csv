0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This method returns a shallow clone of the hash reference.  The return value
0.000000,0,0.000000,is a reference to a new hash with the same keys and values.  It is I<shallow>
0.000000,0,0.000000,because any values that were references in the original will be the I<same>

0.000000,0,0.000000,Note that C<each> is deliberately omitted, due to its stateful interaction
0.000000,0,0.000000,with the hash iterator. C<keys> or C<kv> are much safer.
