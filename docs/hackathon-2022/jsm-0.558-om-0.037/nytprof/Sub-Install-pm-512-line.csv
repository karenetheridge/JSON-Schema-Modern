0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod This module makes it easy to install subroutines into packages without the
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod unsightly mess of C<no strict> or typeglobs lying about where just anyone can
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod see them.

0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod   Sub::Install::install_sub({
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod    code => \&subroutine,
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod    into => "Finance::Shady",
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod    as   => 'launder',

0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod This routine installs a given code reference into a package as a normal
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod subroutine.  The above is equivalent to:
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod   no strict 'refs';
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod   *{"Finance::Shady" . '::' . "launder"} = \&subroutine;
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod If C<into> is not given, the sub is installed into the calling package.
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod If C<code> is not a code reference, it is looked for as an existing sub in the
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod package named in the C<from> parameter.  If C<from> is not given, it will look
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod in the calling package.
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod If C<as> is not given, and if C<code> is a name, C<as> will default to C<code>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod If C<as> is not given, but if C<code> is a code ref, Sub::Install will try to
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod find the name of the given code ref and use that as C<as>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,#pod
